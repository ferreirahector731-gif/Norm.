## Overview

**Norm.** is a multimodal, local-first productivity suite that unifies your knowledge on a single infinite canvas at 120 FPS. Built on the principle that **no one decides for you — not even the app**, it eliminates the need for multiple subscriptions by integrating 10 native modules into a single fluid workspace:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Note** | High-speed Markdown editor for rapid idea capture |
| **Doc** | Structured documentation with flexible rich-text blocks |
| **Canvas** | Infinite whiteboard to interconnect concepts, notes, and visual objects |
| **Sheet** | Liquid databases and tables that project instantly onto the canvas |
| **Chart** | Dynamic, interactive graphs live-synced to your data |
| **Task** | Full project management with NLP-powered task entry |
| **Link** | Knowledge graphs with automatic bidirectional linking and backlink discovery |
| **Music** | Local and online audio playback in background with lock-screen controls |
| **Alarm** | Smart alarms with full-screen lock-screen alerts and calendar integration |
| **Calendar** | Visual scheduling that projects alarms and tasks onto a timeline |

## What's New in v1.9.0

### 🔔 Full-Screen Lock-Screen Alarms
- Alarms wake the screen (`turnScreenOn`) and show over the lock screen (`showWhenLocked`) using the full-screen intent API.
- Exact alarm scheduling (`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` / `USE_EXACT_ALARM`) for millisecond-precision reminders.
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` enables rich notifications on Android 13+.

### 💬 Bubbles (Floating Windows)
- The `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission powers floating note bubbles that stay on top of any app.

### 🎵 Background Music Playback
- `audio_service` foreground service (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`) keeps playback alive when the app is closed, with `MediaButtonReceiver` for wired headset/bluetooth controls.
- `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` / `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` grants access to on-device tracks.

### 📱 Android Native Wiring (v1.9.0)
| Component | Entry |
|---|---|
| Audio service | `com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioService` |
| Media button receiver | `com.ryanheise.audioservice.MediaButtonReceiver` |
| Alarm service | `dev.gdelataillade.alarm.services.AlarmService` |
| Alarm receiver | `dev.gdelataillade.alarm.receivers.AlarmReceiver` |
| Boot persistence | `dev.gdelataillade.alarm.receivers.BootReceiver` (`BOOT_COMPLETED`, `LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `QUICKBOOT_POWERON`) |
| Main activity | `showWhenLocked="true"`, `turnScreenOn="true"` |

Alarms survive device reboots, playback continues in the background, and bubbles are always available — all wired in [`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`](./android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml).

## Architecture & Philosophy

### 🔒 Absolute Data Sovereignty (Local-First)

- **Zero-trust privacy**: All data lives locally on your device via the **Isar** embedded database engine — no cloud gateways, no telemetry, no surveillance.
- **Vendor lock-in impossible**: Your information is stored in open, accessible formats. Export to Markdown, JSON, CSV, or compressed archives with a single click.
- **Offline by default**: Fully functional with zero network dependencies. Optional Supabase sync for cross-device workflows when you choose.

### ⚡ Liquid Data — Cross-Module Polymorphism

Every piece of content can be referenced, embedded, or projected into any other module in real time:

- A **Sheet row** instantiates as an interactive **Chart** series or a **Task** item
- A **Canvas node** embeds a live **Doc** fragment or **Note**
- A **Link** automatically discovers backlinks across all 7 modules
- All mutations propagate atomically at **120 FPS** through the `LiquidDataSync` engine

### 🔄 Universal Import / Export (Zero-Friction Migration)

| Source | Format | Preservation |
|---|---|---|
| **Obsidian** | `.md` vault | YAML frontmatter, `[[wikilinks]]`, `#tags` |
| **Notion** | Markdown + CSV export | Databases → Sheet, pages → Doc/Note |
| **Office** | CSV, JSON, OPML | Raw import with automatic type detection |
| **Export** | Markdown, JSON (flat/gzip), CSV | Full metadata + frontmatter |
